# assaultbot
A Twitter bot that tweets words from a dictionary, with optional prefix and postfix pre/ap-pended.

Based on tweepy.

You will need to edit the script and insert your Twitter API details. Also be sure to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the script, pass it an argument pointing to a text file containing one word per line. A sample dictionary.txt file is included.

```bash
./assaultbot.py dictionary.txt
```

The script is well-commented, and there are a couple other things you can configure. Read the comments for more info.
